  <!-- There wasn't as much positioning, per se, but I think I feel more confident with margins and padding and when to use pixels and percentages. With positioning, it was interesting that since the columns had inline-block display and were vertically aligned from the top, the image of octocat didn't put them out of balance with each other when we placed it to the side or center. Also, we saw to it that the widths of the columns should add up to less than 100% to account for padding and margins. While JS Fiddle (where we did most of the work) is useful, it is still a must to look at the page in a full web browser (as opposed to jus the preview within JS Fiddle) Lupita showed me how to use import a Google font right into the CSS, which was useful. 

  It was also interesting to see how much we had to increase the margin tops of the h2 headings to create some space between those headings and the boxes (details tags) above them. There is definitely a lot of documentation that goes along with CSS, not just with tags, but with fonts and colors, so it can be easy to meander through it when there isn't an overall design set for it. There was some experimentation with color, for example, to make sure the borders were visible. Hue over similar hue can be hard to visualize at first, so a darker blue ended up being chosen over a lighter blue. I hadn't used the filter property for the img hover pseudoselector, so that was interesting. Also, we included a webkit for the filter property for rendering on Safari. An important part of web development is that there are multiple browsers and many different versions of browsers, so it is not always a given that you see on your preferred browser is what your client sees on his or her preferred browser. Also, this project showed how semantic tags can take the place of divs (like the details, summary, and code tags). I'm starting to know the names of more commonly used properties and when to use them, even recovering from misaligned displays of stylesheets past (although that was more to do with the finicky side nav and extra-finicky footer in my solo challenge last week). While the design of the page was simple, there was more instant gratification in seeing the changes. -->
