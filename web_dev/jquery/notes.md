## Tackling JQuery
* Look for overall lessons on JQuery
	* There isn't much overall, since it is a library, but it helped a little to at least go through the steps to setting it up (linking the jquery, starting with the document.ready function, etc.)
* Look for documentation for specifics
	* Documentation WITH examples (like those on W3 schools) were more helpful to actually visualize what was going on. Also, helpful to muck around with the code in their console.
* Test new things with a test webpage
	* Figure out what the equivalent would have been without JQuery to better understand what's going on
		* The function were usually pretty self-explanatory
	* If something goes wrong, check documentation
		* But also check code itself. Sometimes it was forgotten quotation marks that made something not work
	* If something goes wrong with further experimentation, look up discussions on what went wrong 
		* This was helpful as at first I wasn't sure if I had to download jQuery or not.
* Breaks can be taken
